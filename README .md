## 📌 Problem Statement  
Most existing online coding platforms face three major challenges:  
1. **Lack of fairness** – Cheating during contests reduces credibility.  
2. **Unstructured preparation** – Learners cannot easily find company-wise problems for focused interview practice.  
3. **Limited personalized guidance** – Learners often struggle without intelligent support while solving problems.  

There is a need for a **fair, AI-powered, and career-focused coding ecosystem**.

## 🎥 Camera Proctoring Troubleshooting

If you're experiencing issues with the camera proctoring system, please refer to our detailed troubleshooting guide:

- [Proctoring Troubleshooting Guide](PROCTORING_TROUBLESHOOTING.md) - Comprehensive guide for diagnosing and resolving proctoring issues

### Quick Test Script

You can verify that the computer vision libraries are properly installed by running:

```bash
python test_cv.py
```

Expected output:
```
Testing computer vision library imports...
==================================================
NumPy version: 1.26.4
NumPy import successful
OpenCV version: 4.11.0
OpenCV import successful
MediaPipe version: 0.10.21
MediaPipe import successful
==================================================
All tests completed!
Computer vision libraries are ready.
```

If any libraries fail to import, the proctoring system will automatically disable itself and allow access to contests without camera monitoring.

Common issues and solutions:
1. **Camera Access Denied** - Check browser permissions and ensure no other applications are using the camera
2. **Proctoring Not Starting** - Verify contest settings and check browser console for errors
3. **Face Detection Issues** - Ensure proper lighting and camera positioning

You can also test your camera independently by navigating to `/camera-test/` in your browser.
